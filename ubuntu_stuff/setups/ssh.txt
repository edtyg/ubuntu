ssh = secure shell
/etc/ssh/		 		# standard location for settings


sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install ssh
sudo ufw allow ssh


ip addr 				# can lookup your ip address here - ssh default port is 22
grep -i port /etc/ssh/sshd_config 	# can check port here
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config		# can update file here - uncomment by taking out
sudo systemctl restart sshd 		# restart after changing settings
sudo ss -tulpn | grep ssh 		# check if listening on port correctly


### adding key file ###
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 		# overwrite file (if key exists)
cd /home/user/.ssh			# cd to ssh folder for user

id_rsa					# private key
id_rsa.pub				# public key
nano authorized_keys			# add in public key from id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys file (create if it doesnt exist)
sudo systemctl restart ssh		# restart ssh service

permissions of user folder matters as well
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
