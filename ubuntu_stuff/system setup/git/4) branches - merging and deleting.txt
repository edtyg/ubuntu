###
merging branch into main

While you are working on your branch, 
other developers may update the main branch with their branch. 
This action means your branch is now out of date of the main branch and missing content. 
You can merge the main branch into your branch by checking out your branch and using the same git merge command.

git checkout main
git merge <branch you are working on>
git push

###
merging main into current branch you are working on
git checkout <your current branch>
git merge main
git push


# can delete branch when you are done
git branch -d <branch you want to delete>
