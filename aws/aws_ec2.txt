stopping instance without elastic ip address -> will be relocated a new ip address
shutting down of system (same as above)

assigning an elastic ip to a server that's already running -> will change current server's ip to the new 1
(can't create a custom elastic ip)

upgrading server that has an elastic ip assigned will not have a new ip assigned
