existing instances without an elastic ip allocated will have a new ip address whenever it reboots / stopped
upgrading an existing instance would also require it to be stopped
therefore it would be best to assign an elastic ip whenever a new instance is created


assigning an elastic ip to a server that's already running -> will change current server's ip to the new 1
(can't create a custom elastic ip)

upgrading server that has an elastic ip assigned will not have a new ip assigned
